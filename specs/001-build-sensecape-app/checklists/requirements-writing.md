# Requirements Quality Checklist: Sensecape Exploration App

**Purpose**: Validate requirement quality (completeness, clarity, consistency, measurability, and coverage) before implementation and review.
**Created**: 2026-03-02
**Feature**: `/home/kush/researchlm/specs/001-build-sensecape-app/spec.md`

**Note**: This checklist evaluates how well requirements are written; it does not evaluate implementation behavior.

- [x] CHK034 Are "practical performance budget checks" defined with minimum evidence artifacts and acceptance thresholds? [Ambiguity, Spec §Testing & Verification Requirements, Plan §Constitution Check] Result: PASS - artifact set now explicitly requires p95 metrics with rerun metadata, and thresholds are specified in performance requirements.

## Prioritized Remediation List

1. All identified P0-P3 remediation actions are now incorporated into specification and planning artifacts.
2. Maintain this checklist as a regression baseline; rerun after any requirement updates.
