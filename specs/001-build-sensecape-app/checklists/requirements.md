# Specification Quality Checklist: Sensecape Exploration App

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-03-02  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation result: PASS on first iteration.
- Scope interpretation applied: implement product behavior from the paper's system design, excluding study replication and publication artifacts.

## Verification Run Outputs (2026-03-03)

- [x] `npm run format:check` (known repository-wide warnings tracked; no new formatting blockers introduced by US4 scope)
- [x] `npm run lint` pass
- [x] `npm run typecheck` pass
- [x] `npm run test` pass (85 tests)
- [x] `npm run build` pass
- [x] `npm run test:e2e` pass (14 tests)

## Constitution Compliance Sign-off

- [x] Code quality gates (lint/typecheck/build) executed and recorded.
- [x] Automated testing includes unit, integration, contract, and e2e coverage for touched workflows.
- [x] Non-blocking UX behavior validated for retry and conflict notices.
- [x] Performance budget checks added and verified via integration performance tests.
- [x] Requirement/task traceability updates scheduled and actively maintained.

## Traceability Completeness

- [x] Every FR-001..FR-037 entry is mapped to at least one task in `specs/001-build-sensecape-app/traceability.md`.
- [x] Non-functional requirement groups (Code Quality, Testing & Verification, UX Consistency, Performance) are mapped to task IDs in `specs/001-build-sensecape-app/traceability.md`.
- [x] No requirement row is left with an empty task mapping.
