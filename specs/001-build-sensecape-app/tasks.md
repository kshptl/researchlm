# Tasks: Sensecape Exploration App

**Input**: Design documents from `/home/kush/researchlm/specs/001-build-sensecape-app/`
**Prerequisites**: `plan.md` (required), `spec.md` (required), `research.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/`, `quickstart.md`

**Tests**: Include test tasks by default. User stories include unit, integration, and e2e coverage; contract tests are required for external or cross-boundary interfaces (streaming/API/UI contracts).

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story so each story can be implemented and validated independently.

## Constitution Check (Task List)

- **Code Quality**: PASS - quality gates and maintainability tasks are explicitly present (`T001`, `T003`, `T127`, `T132`).
- **Testing Standards**: PASS - unit/integration/e2e coverage appears per story, with contract tests for cross-boundary interfaces (`T033`, `T034`, `T119`, `T120`).
- **UX Consistency**: PASS - accessibility, focus order/restoration, terminology, and messaging coverage is explicitly planned (`T124`, `T125`, `T142`, `T149`).
- **Performance Requirements**: PASS - p95 budget checks and evidence capture tasks are explicitly present (`T121`, `T122`, `T123`, `T128`, `T143`).
- **Visual Quality**: PASS - deterministic visual-regression coverage, baseline governance, and rubric-evidence tasks are explicitly planned (`T152`-`T169`).
- **Evidence Plan**: PASS - traceability, verification artifact, and visual rubric-evidence tasks are explicitly present (`T131`, `T138`, `T144`, `T145`, `T169`).

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: No dependencies.
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Depends on Phase 1. Blocks all user stories.
- **Phase 3 (US1)**: Depends on Phase 2.
- **Phase 4 (US2)**: Depends on Phase 2. Can run after US1 baseline UI shell is merged.
- **Phase 5 (US3)**: Depends on Phase 2. Can run after US1 node rendering baseline is merged.
- **Phase 6 (US4)**: Depends on Phase 2. Integrates best after US1 persistence interactions exist.
- **Phase 7 (Polish)**: Depends on completion of all targeted user stories.
- **Phase 8 (Visual Quality)**: Depends on Phase 7 and stabilized user-story UI states.
- **Merge Gate Rule**: For user-facing changes, merge/release-candidate approval is BLOCKED until Phase 8 tasks are complete and visual CI gates pass.

### User Story Dependency Graph

- **US1 (P1)** -> Core canvas exploration MVP
- **US2 (P2)** -> Hierarchy workflows extending canvas baseline
- **US3 (P3)** -> Semantic abstraction controls on top of node rendering
- **US4 (P3)** -> Durability/recovery/conflict/credential continuity across workspace flows

Recommended completion order: **US1 -> US2 -> US3 -> US4**

### Within Each User Story

- Write tests first and confirm failing expectations.
- Implement state/domain changes before UI integration.
- Implement route/adapter behavior after contract tests exist.
- Validate independent story acceptance before proceeding.

### Parallel Opportunities

- Setup: T004, T005, T006, T007, T008, T009, T010 can run in parallel after T001-T003.
- Foundational: T014-T022 and T025-T029 can run in parallel after T013.
- US1: T033-T043 in parallel for tests; T061-T065 in parallel for provider adapters.
- US2: T067-T072 in parallel for tests; T074-T076 in parallel for UI work.
- US3: T084-T088 in parallel for tests; T090-T092 in parallel for semantic modules.
- US4: T098-T105 in parallel for tests; T107-T111 in parallel for persistence services.
- Polish: T119-T124, T133-T136, T139-T142, T144, T146, T148, and T149 can run in parallel.
- Visual phase: T152-T154 and T166 can run in parallel; T157-T160 can run in parallel after T154-T156; T167-T169 can run after T161-T166.

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 only)

1. Complete Phase 1 and Phase 2.
2. Complete Phase 3 (US1).
3. Validate US1 independently through contract, unit, integration, and e2e tests.
4. Demo/deploy MVP before expanding scope.

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational complete -> stable base.
2. Deliver US1 -> validate -> story candidate.
3. Deliver US2 -> validate -> story candidate.
4. Deliver US3 -> validate -> story candidate.
5. Deliver US4 -> validate -> story candidate.
6. Run Phase 7 polish and quality/performance evidence.
7. Block release-candidate/merge until visual gates pass (`T152`-`T169`, including coverage validation, metadata gates, and rubric evidence artifacts).

### Parallel Team Strategy

1. Team completes Phases 1-2 together.
2. Split by story after foundation stabilization:
   - Engineer A: US1
   - Engineer B: US2
   - Engineer C: US3
   - Engineer D: US4
3. Reconcile in Phase 7 with full gate evidence.
4. Run Phase 8 visual baseline generation/review and CI gate stabilization.

## Notes

- [P] tasks indicate no file-level dependency on unfinished tasks.
- User story labels ensure traceability back to spec acceptance scenarios.
- Each story phase is scoped to be independently testable and demonstrable.
- Constitution quality, testing, UX, and performance obligations are enforced as explicit tasks.
